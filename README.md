# Merge JSON Files Script

This Python script merges multiple JSON files into a single file and monitors them for updates. It is designed to be used in Google Colab for managing Swagger/OpenAPI specification files dynamically.

## Overview

The script performs two main functions:

1. **Initial Merge**: Combines all JSON files in the 'api' folder into a single `ets_doc.json` file.
2. **Watch for Changes**: Monitors the 'api' folder for any modifications to JSON files and updates `ets_doc.json` accordingly.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook environment.   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oEla4xdVF5EOwviLBXFVnyWla-1bpQmb?usp=sharing
- JSON files structured according to Swagger/OpenAPI specifications in the 'api' folder.

## Setup

1. **Upload JSON Files**: Ensure your Swagger/OpenAPI JSON files are uploaded to the 'api' folder within your Google Colab environment.
2. **Upload the Script**: Upload the `merge_json.py` script to your Colab environment.

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. **Initial Merge**:
   ```python
   from glob import glob
   initial_merge_and_write()
   ```
   This function merges all JSON files initially and creates `ets_doc.json`.

2. **Watch for Changes**:
   ```python
   watch_for_changes()
   ```
   This function starts monitoring the 'api' folder for any changes in JSON files. It runs indefinitely until interrupted.

### Example Workflow

- Upload your Swagger/OpenAPI JSON files to the 'api' folder.
- Execute `initial_merge_and_write()` to create `ets_doc.json`.
- Start `watch_for_changes()` to automatically update `ets_doc.json` whenever any JSON file in the 'api' folder is modified.

## Notes

- Ensure the structure and format of your JSON files adhere to Swagger/OpenAPI specifications for proper merging and compatibility.
- This script assumes all JSON files in the 'api' folder are valid Swagger/OpenAPI documents.

## Troubleshooting

- **No JSON Files Found**: If the script reports no JSON files found in the 'api' folder, ensure your files are uploaded and the path is correct.
